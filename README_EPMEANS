This is the code to perform both the EP-Means
approach on one dimensional CDFs and the K-Means
approach with 2-dimensional probability distributions
along with the Bhattacharyya distance metric.

Both files were run in the Matlab console(R2017b). 
The EP-Means file will output a graph of the controids
produced. The mesh function can be used to view
the resulting centroids for the EP-Means_BCdist
file.

The variable for the reulting centroids for both
algorithms is centroids. For EP-Means, centroids
is a K-by-(valid values) matrix, with each row
being a centroid. For EP-Means_BCdist, centroids
is a 100-by-232-by-K matrix, with each 2-dimensional
matrix being a centroid.

In BCdist, the variable diff_from_noise is the
Bhattacharyya distance of each centroid from the
"noise" distribution, or the probability density of
all tweets.

Occasionally the file will produce an error with the
datasample function, though this is typically fixed
simply by attempting to run the file again.

This code also used files to read in NPY files. These
files were found here:

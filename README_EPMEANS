This is the code to perform both the EP-Means
approach on one dimensional CDFs and the K-Means
approach with 2-dimensional probability distributions
along with the Bhattacharyya distance metric.

Both files were run in the Matlab console. The 
EP-Means file will output a graph of the controids
produced. The mesh function can be used to view
the resulting centroids for the EP-Means_BCdist
file.

The variable for the reulting centroids for both
algorithms is centroids. For EP-Means, centroids
is a K-by-(valid values) matrix, with each row
being a centroid. For EP-Means_BCdist, centroids
is a 100-by-232-by-K matrix, with each 2-dimensional
matrix being a centroid.

This code also used files to read in NPY files. These
files were found here:
